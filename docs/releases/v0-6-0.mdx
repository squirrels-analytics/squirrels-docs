<Intro/>

The following are fixes and new features for [v0.6.0].

## Fixes

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Renamed the `SquirrelsProject.dataset` method to `SquirrelsProject.dataset_result` to avoid confusion with the `DashboardArgs.dataset` method. Although the two methods had the same name, they had different purposes and return different types.

## New features

**[BREAKING CHANGE] Mounting Squirrels APIs into an existing FastAPI application**

- Added the `SquirrelsProject.get_fastapi_components` method to get the FastAPI components for the Squirrels project including mount path, lifespan, and FastAPI app. This allows you to [mount the Squirrels APIs into an existing FastAPI application](/guides/mount-to-fastapi).
- Since the project name and version are now included in the mount path, they have been removed from the rest of the API path for all endpoints. THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE. See the /docs endpoint of the Squirrels API server for the updated API endpoints.
- Running with `sqrl run` (i.e., in "standalone mode") is equivalent to mounting the Squirrels APIs to the default mount path of `/analytics/{project_name}/v{project_version}` and running the main FastAPI app.

**Dashboard context variables and configurables**

- Dashboards now have access to context variables defined in `context.py`. This allows dashboards to use dynamic logic based on parameter selections and user attributes, similar to how datasets work.
- The `sqrl` argument in the dashboard's `main` function now includes a `ctx` dictionary containing the context variables.
- Dashboards can now override project-level configurables in their `.yml` configuration files using the `configurables` key.
- These overrides are automatically merged with project-level defaults and are accessible via `sqrl.configurables` in the dashboard logic.
