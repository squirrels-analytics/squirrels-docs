<Intro/>

The following are fixes and new features for [v0.6.0].

## Fixes

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Renamed the `SquirrelsProject.dataset` method to `SquirrelsProject.dataset_result` to avoid confusion with the `DashboardArgs.dataset` method. Although the two methods had the same name, they had different purposes and return different types.

## New features

**[BREAKING CHANGE] Mounting Squirrels APIs into an existing FastAPI application**

- Added the `SquirrelsProject.get_fastapi_components` method to get the FastAPI components for the Squirrels project including mount path, lifespan, and FastAPI app. This allows you to [mount the Squirrels APIs into an existing FastAPI application](/guides/mount-to-fastapi).
- Since the project name and version are now included in the mount path, they have been removed from the rest of the API path for all endpoints. THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE. See the /docs endpoint of the Squirrels API server for the updated API endpoints.
- Running with `sqrl run` (i.e., in "standalone mode") is equivalent to mounting the Squirrels APIs to the default mount path of `/analytics/{project_name}/v{project_version}` and running the main FastAPI app.

**External auth strategy (`auth_strategy: external`)**

- Added `project_variables.auth_strategy` in `squirrels.yml`, allowing you to choose between:
  - `managed` (default): Squirrels-managed users, passwords, and API keys
  - `external`: Trust an external OAuth authorization server and validate provider-issued Bearer tokens
- When `auth_strategy` is `external`:
  - `auth_type` defaults to `required` and `auth_type: optional` is not allowed.
  - You must define **exactly one** auth provider in `pyconfigs/user.py`, and that provider should support **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**.
  - Provider-issued Bearer tokens may be **JWTs** (validated via JWKS) or **opaque tokens** (validated via `userinfo_endpoint`, with fallback to `introspection_endpoint` when available).
  - Certain Squirrels-managed auth endpoints are disabled (e.g., username/password login, API keys, user management).
  - Environment variables used for managed auth (such as `SQRL_SECRET__ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `SQRL_AUTH__DB_FILE_PATH`, and `SQRL_AUTH__TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`) do not apply.
- Added `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (OAuth 2.1 Protected Resource Metadata, RFC 9728) to help OAuth-aware clients discover the authorization server(s) when running in standalone mode.
- MCP server auth: when `auth_strategy` is `external` and `auth_type` is `required`, the MCP server requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and responds with HTTP 401 + `WWW-Authenticate` pointing to the protected resource metadata endpoint.

**Dashboard context variables and configurables**

- Dashboards now have access to context variables defined in `context.py`. This allows dashboards to use dynamic logic based on parameter selections and user attributes, similar to how datasets work.
- The `sqrl` argument in the dashboard's `main` function now includes a `ctx` dictionary containing the context variables.
- Dashboards can now override project-level configurables in their `.yml` configuration files using the `configurables` key.
- These overrides are automatically merged with project-level defaults and are accessible via `sqrl.configurables` in the dashboard logic.
