<Intro/>

The following are fixes and new features for [v0.6.0].

## Fixes

- **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Renamed the `SquirrelsProject.dataset` method to `SquirrelsProject.dataset_result` to avoid confusion with the `DashboardArgs.dataset` method. Although the two methods had the same name, they had different purposes and return different types.

## New features

**[BREAKING CHANGE] Mounting Squirrels APIs into an existing FastAPI application**

- Added the `SquirrelsProject.get_fastapi_components` method to get the FastAPI components for the Squirrels project including mount path, lifespan, and FastAPI app. This allows you to [mount the Squirrels APIs into an existing FastAPI application](/guides/mount-to-fastapi).
- Since the project name and version are now included in the mount path, they have been removed from the rest of the API path for all endpoints. THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE. See the /docs endpoint of the Squirrels API server for the updated API endpoints.
- Running with `sqrl run` (i.e., in "standalone mode") is equivalent to mounting the Squirrels APIs to the default mount path of `/analytics/{project_name}/v{project_version}` and running the main FastAPI app.

**External auth strategy (`auth_strategy: external`)**

- Added `project_variables.auth_strategy` in `squirrels.yml`, allowing you to choose between:
  - `managed` (default): Squirrels-managed users, passwords, and API keys
  - `external`: Trust an external OAuth authorization server and validate provider-issued Bearer tokens
- When `auth_strategy` is `external`:
  - `auth_type` defaults to `required` and `auth_type: optional` is not allowed.
  - You must define **exactly one** auth provider in `pyconfigs/user.py`, and that provider should support **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**.
  - Provider-issued Bearer tokens may be **JWTs** (validated via JWKS) or **opaque tokens** (validated via `userinfo_endpoint`, with fallback to `introspection_endpoint` when available).
  - Certain Squirrels-managed auth endpoints are disabled (e.g., username/password login, API keys, user management).
  - Environment variables used for managed auth (such as `SQRL_SECRET__ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `SQRL_AUTH__DB_FILE_PATH`, and `SQRL_AUTH__TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`) do not apply.
- Added `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (OAuth 2.1 Protected Resource Metadata, RFC 9728) to help OAuth-aware clients discover the authorization server(s) when running in standalone mode.
- MCP server auth: when `auth_strategy` is `external` and `auth_type` is `required`, the MCP server requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and responds with HTTP 401 + `WWW-Authenticate` pointing to the protected resource metadata endpoint.

**Using MCP's `_meta` field for configurables**

- It is now possible to pass configurables to MCP tools by specifying them in the `_meta` field of the tool call. More details on the `_meta` field can be found in the [MCP specifications here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/index#_meta).
- Just like before, the user must have elevated access level to pass configurables to MCP tools. This usually means the user is an admin unless the `SQRL_PERMISSIONS__ELEVATED_ACCESS_LEVEL` environment variable is set to a lower value.
- For example, if you have a configurable called `schema_name` in your project, you can pass it as a `_meta` field in the tool call with the key `schema_name`. Support for the request header format `x-config-schema-name` is also available for backwards compatibility.
- Example JSON-RPC request body:
```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_dataset_results_from_my_project",
    "arguments": {
      ...
    },
    "_meta": {
      "schema_name": "my_schema"
    }
  }
}
```

**Dashboard context variables and configurables**

- Dashboards now have access to context variables defined in `context.py`. This allows dashboards to use dynamic logic based on parameter selections and user attributes, similar to how datasets work.
- The `sqrl` argument in the dashboard's `main` function now includes a `ctx` dictionary containing the context variables.
- Dashboards can now override project-level configurables in their `.yml` configuration files using the `configurables` key.
- These overrides are automatically merged with project-level defaults and are accessible via `sqrl.configurables` in the dashboard logic.
